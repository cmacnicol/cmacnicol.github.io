<h1>Connor MacNicol</h1>

I am available every afternoon except for Tuesday nights. 

I am willing to work on this project for at least 2 hours a night. 
<quote>I am more than willing to work more if needed. I want this piece of software to be great!</quote>

<h2>The following are my elevator pitches or software ideas.</h2>

1. For Artists
who need inspiration,
Creative Craft
is a image gallery
that provides visual inspiration.
Unlike https://conceptartempire.com/inspiration/
our product will provide particular art dependant on the user's selection.

2. For Plant Owners
who need a way to remind them of a watering schedule,
Leaf It Alone
is a reminder and schedule application
that sets a custom schedule based on the plant type.
Unlike https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planta-keep-your-plants-alive/id1410126781
our product allows full customization of schedules.

3. For Budget Conscious Shoppers
who need a clear limit,
Shop Safe
is a budgeted shopping list
that provides reminders and categories.
Unlike https://apps.apple.com/hr/app/anylist-grocery-shopping-list/id522167641
